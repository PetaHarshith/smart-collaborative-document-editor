 Smart Collaborative Document Editing Platform

Welcome to the Smart Collaborative Document Editing Platform! This project aims to create a web-based platform that allows users to collaboratively edit documents in real-time. The platform incorporates machine learning for natural language processing tasks such as grammar correction and auto-suggestions, ensuring efficient and secure collaboration.

 Key Features

1. Real-Time Collaboration:
   - Multiple users can edit a document simultaneously with real-time updates.

2. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
   - Grammar and spell check.
   - Sentiment analysis to understand the tone of the document.
   - Auto-suggestions and predictive text.

3. Security:
   - User authentication and authorization.
   - Secure communication channels (HTTPS, WebSockets with TLS).
   - Data encryption.

4. Distributed Systems:
   - Scalable architecture using microservices.
   - Load balancing and fault tolerance.

5. Networking:
   - Efficient data synchronization across clients.
   - Real-time updates using WebSockets.

6. Information Retrieval:
   - Search functionality to quickly find documents and content within documents.

 Tech Stack

1. Frontend:
   - Web: React.js, Redux
   - Mobile: React Native

2. Backend:
   - Node.js with Express.js or Flask (Python)
   - Microservices architecture

3. Database:
   - NoSQL (MongoDB) for document storage
   - SQL (PostgreSQL) for user management and analytics

4. **Machine Learning:**
   - Python (scikit-learn, NLTK, SpaCy for NLP tasks)

5. Security:
   - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
   - HTTPS for secure communication

6. Deployment:
   - Docker for containerization
   - AWS/GCP for cloud services

7. Version Control:
   - Git and GitHub for source code management
